# Cheval

Cheval is an (overly) simple python-based chess game analysis tool that incorporates LLM-based analysis of positions. It uses Stockfish to perform raw position evaluations, hard-coded rules to classify plies, and a large language model to generate summaries and commentary of play for both Black and White.
